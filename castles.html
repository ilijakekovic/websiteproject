            Do you like castles? The Castles of Scotland Tour
            is for you. The tour visits 15 differents castles in
            central and northern Scotland. The tour starts with the
            famous Edinburgh Castle, and <i>Travel Scotland!</i>
            has
            a special arrangement to visit parts of the castle
            normally closed to the public.
        </p>
        <p class="text2" id="maintext">
            From Edinburgh you travel to Stirling Castle with
            breathtaking views of the River Forth as it divides
            Scotland's Highlands and Lowlands. Inverness is next on
            the Itinerary with a side trip to Culloden to view where
            the campaign of Bonnie Prince Charlie came to an end.

            Look for Nessie from Castle Urquhart on the banks of Loch
            Ness. From there goes into the heart of the Highlands
            with trips to Fort William and Oban. We've made special
            plans to picnic by Castle Stalker near Glencoe.

            No castle tour would be complete with a trip to Balmacara
            Castle on the Isle of Skye. While on Skye, we'll have a
            boat trip along the feet of the Black Cullins.

            The tour concludes with two days back in Edinburgh for
            shopping, additional site-seeing, or just rest and
            relaxation.
